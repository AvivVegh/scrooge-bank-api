## Overview

Scrooge Bank API is a RESTful banking service that simulates real-world banking operations including user registration, account creation, deposits, withdrawals, loan applications, and loan payments. The API is built with security and reliability in mind, featuring JWT authentication, idempotency keys, and comprehensive transaction management.

Scrooge Bank has opened for business! We are targeting customers who are technically savvy and have decided they love doing banking all via API Requests.

We are starting off with only two types of accounts - Checking Accounts and Personal Loans. We want our customers to be able to withdraw and deposit money into their checking accounts, and for loan customers to apply for loans that distribute outside the bank.

We are pretty generous, so any loan our bank can cover, we will approve at a 0% interest. So much for our scrooge reputation!

Our bank is starting off with $250,000 USD to cover loans, and we are also allowed to use up to 25% of the customers' money on hand.

## User Stories

### 1. General

- As the bank operator, I should be able to see how much money total we currently have on hand.
- As the bank operator, user withdrawals are allowed to put the bank into debt, but loans are not.

### 2. Accounts

- As a user, I should be able to open an Account
- As a user, I should be able to close an Account
- As a user, I should not be allowed to have more than 1 open account

### 3. Deposits

- As a user, I should be able to make a deposit to my account
- As a user, If I do not have an account when I deposit, I should see an error
- As a user, I should not be able to make deposits to other people's accounts

### 4. Withdrawals

- As a user, I should be able to make a withdrawal from my account
- As a user, is I do not have enough funds, I should see an error
- As a user, I should not be able to make withdrawals from other people's accounts

### 5. Loans

- As a user, I should be able to apply for a loan
- As a user, my loan should be accepted if the bank has enough money to cover it
- As a user, when I apply for a loan, it should be rejected if the bank doesn't have enough money to cover it.
- As a user, I can make a payment on my loan

### 6. Authentication - Self-Directed User Story

#### User Story: Access & Role Discovery

As an authenticated user, I need to:

- obtain an access token to call protected APIs, and
- discover my effective roles/permissions, so that my UI and actions are tailored to what I'm allowed to do.

#### Why did I pick this story?

- Auth is the "first mile" dependency for everything else. Without a reliable way to get a token and know what I can do, every other feature is blocked or implemented inconsistently across services. This story unblocks developers, enables role-gated UX, and creates a single source of truth for authorization.

#### What user value does it deliver?

- Clarity & speed: Users immediately see what they can do; no trial-and-error errors.
- Security: Principle of least privilege via roles/permissions, audit-friendly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22 or higher)
- PostgreSQL database
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd scrooge-bank-api

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the `env.example` file:

```env
# Database
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=your_db_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_DATABASE=scrooge_bank

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_jwt_refresh_secret_key

# Server
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Running the Application

The easiest way to run the Scrooge Bank API is using Docker Compose, which will set up both the application and PostgreSQL database in containers.

#### Prerequisites for Docker

- Docker Engine (v20.10 or higher)
- Docker Compose (v2.0 or higher)

#### Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd scrooge-bank-api

# Start all services (database + API)
docker-compose up
```

The application will automatically:

1. ‚úÖ Pull and start PostgreSQL database
2. ‚úÖ Build the NestJS application
3. ‚úÖ Run database migrations
4. ‚úÖ Seed the database with initial data
5. ‚úÖ Start the API server

**Access the API:**

- **API:** `http://localhost:3001`
- **Swagger Documentation:** `http://localhost:3001/api`
- **Database:** `localhost:5432`

#### Docker Commands

```bash
# Start services in detached mode (background)
docker-compose up -d --build

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View logs for specific service
docker-compose logs -f app
docker-compose logs -f postgres

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (clears database)
docker-compose down -v
```

#### Docker Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines two services:

**PostgreSQL Database:**

- Image: `postgres:15-alpine`
- Port: `5432` (mapped to host)
- Database: `scrooge_bank`
- Username: `postgres`
- Password: `postgres`
- Volume: `postgres_data_dev` (persists data)

**NestJS Application:**

- Port: `3000` (container) ‚Üí `3001` (host)
- Auto-runs migrations and seeding
- Hot-reload enabled with volume mounting
- Health check endpoint configured

#### Environment Variables (Docker)

The docker-compose file sets these environment variables automatically:

```yaml
NODE_ENV: development
DATABASE_HOST: postgres
DATABASE_PORT: 5432
DATABASE_NAME: scrooge_bank
DATABASE_USER: postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD: postgres
BANK_BASE_CASH_AMOUNT: 250000
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET: supersecret
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATION_TIME: 15m
PORT: 3000
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** These are development defaults. For production, use a `.env` file or update the docker-compose configuration with secure values.

#### Customizing Docker Setup

To customize the configuration, you can:

1. **Override environment variables:**

   ```bash
   # Create a .env file in the project root
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your values
   ```

2. **Change the exposed port:**
   Edit `docker-compose.yml` and modify:

   ```yaml
   ports:
     - 'YOUR_PORT:3000'
   ```

**Base url:**

```
http://localhost:3001
```

### üìö Available Endpoint Groups

The Swagger UI organizes endpoints into the following categories:

**üîê Authentication**

- `POST /v1/auth/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /v1/auth/login` - Login existing user
- `POST /v1/auth/refresh` - Refresh access token

**üí∞ Account Management**

- `POST /v1/account/create` - Create a new account
- `GET /v1/account` - Get all user accounts
- `GET /v1/account/:accountId` - Get specific account
- `POST /v1/account/deposit` - Deposit funds
- `POST /v1/account/withdraw` - Withdraw funds
- `GET /v1/account/:accountId/statement` - Get account statement
- `POST /v1/account/close` - Close an account

**üè¶ Loans**

- `POST /v1/loan/apply` - Apply for a loan
- `GET /v1/loan` - Get all user loans
- `POST /v1/loan/:loanId/payment/:paymentId` - Make loan payment

**‚öôÔ∏è Admin/Operator** (requires API key)

- `GET /v1/admin/operator/balance` - Get bank balance
- `GET /v1/admin/operator/loan-funds` - Get available loan funds
- `GET /v1/admin/operator/can-approve-loan` - Check loan approval eligibility

### üí° Tips for Using Swagger

- **Response Codes**: Each endpoint shows all possible HTTP status codes (200, 400, 401, 404, etc.)
- **Schema Validation**: Click on schema examples to see all field types and validation rules
- **Idempotency Keys**: Use unique keys for deposits, withdrawals, and loan applications to prevent duplicates
- **Token Expiration**: If you get a 401 error, your token may have expired - use `/v1/auth/refresh` to get a new one
- **Try Different Scenarios**: Test error cases by providing invalid data or insufficient funds

## Postman Collection

A comprehensive Postman collection is included in the repository for easy API testing and development.

### üì¶ Import the Collection

**File Location:** `bank.postman_collection.json`

**Import Steps:**

1. Open Postman
2. Click **Import** button
3. Select the `bank.postman_collection.json` file from the project root
4. The collection will be imported with all endpoints pre-configured

### ‚ú® Features

The Postman collection includes:

- **Auto-Variable Management**: Variables are automatically set from API responses
- **Pre-configured Endpoints**: All API endpoints with proper request/response examples
- **Environment Ready**: Works with both local and Docker setups
- **Token Management**: Automatic JWT token handling and refresh

### üîß Collection Variables

The collection uses the following variables (auto-managed):

| Variable       | Description        | Auto-Set                         |
| -------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `baseUrl`      | API base URL       | ‚ùå (default: `localhost:3001`)   |
| `accessToken`  | JWT access token   | ‚úÖ (from login/register)         |
| `refreshToken` | JWT refresh token  | ‚úÖ (from login/register)         |
| `userId`       | User ID            | ‚úÖ (extracted from JWT)          |
| `accountId`    | Account ID         | ‚úÖ (from create account)         |
| `loanId`       | Loan ID            | ‚úÖ (from loan apply)             |
| `email`        | User email         | ‚ùå (default: `user@example.com`) |
| `password`     | User password      | ‚ùå (default: `password123`)      |
| `amount`       | Transaction amount | ‚ùå (default: `1000`)             |
| `loanAmount`   | Loan amount        | ‚ùå (default: `100`)              |

### üöÄ Quick Start with Postman

1. **Import the collection** (see steps above)

2. **Set your base URL** (if different from default):
   - Click on the collection
   - Go to **Variables** tab
   - Update `baseUrl` to your API server (e.g., `http://localhost:3001`)

3. **Customize credentials** (optional):
   - Update `email` and `password` variables
   - Or use the default: `user@example.com` / `password123`

4. **Run the workflow**:
   - **Step 1**: Run `POST /v1/auth/register` or `POST /v1/auth/login`
     - ‚úÖ Automatically sets `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, and `userId`
   - **Step 2**: Run `POST /v1/account/create`
     - ‚úÖ Automatically sets `accountId`
   - **Step 3**: Run `POST /v1/account/deposit`
     - Uses the auto-set `accountId`
   - **Step 4**: Run `POST /v1/loan/apply`
     - ‚úÖ Automatically sets `loanId`
   - **Step 5**: Run `POST /v1/loan/:loanId/payment/:paymentId`
     - Uses the auto-set `loanId` and `accountId`

5. **Token expired?**
   - Run `POST /v1/auth/refresh` to get a new access token
     - ‚úÖ Automatically updates `accessToken` and `refreshToken`

### üìã Available Endpoints in Collection

**Authentication:**

- `POST /v1/auth/register` - Register new user

- **No manual token copying** needed - everything is automated
- **Update baseUrl** once and all requests use it
- **Chain requests** by running them in sequence - variables flow automatically
